        <h2>I Buy Coins in Mendocino and Sonoma County</h2>
        <p>
          Got coins you don’t want to deal with? I buy coins in
          <strong>Mendocino and Sonoma County</strong>, roughly from
          <strong>Santa Rosa north to Ukiah and west out to the coast</strong>. That includes towns
          along the coastal strip and in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on <strong>estate coins</strong>, jars, buckets, and old accumulations that are
          too much hassle to sort and haul to the bank.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          You keep your time and your sanity. I handle the dirty work.

        <h2>Estate Coin Cleanouts – I Handle the Heavy, Messy Part</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re dealing with an <strong>estate</strong>, inheritance, or house cleanout
          anywhere between Santa Rosa, Ukiah, and the coast, the coins are usually the
          last thing anyone wants to touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coffee cans, jars, buckets, bags, desk drawers full of change – it’s heavy, it’s dirty,
          and it’s slow to deal with. That’s where I come in.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I come to the property or meet nearby, where practical in my service area.</li>
          <li>I look over the coins in bulk – you don’t have to pre-sort anything.</li>
          <li>I make a clear offer based on volume, condition, and how much work is involved.</li>
          <li>You don’t have to sort, roll, or haul anything to the bank.</li>

        <h2>Simple, Percentage-Based Pricing</h2>
        <p>
          I charge a small percentage to cover gas, travel, time, sorting, and equipment wear.
          You keep the bulk of the value; I take on the work.
